# Why develop a custom PCB?
The OSSM's feature set, such as a header that mates directly to the IHSV57, a pulse/dir header for the 57AIM30, current sensing for [sensorless homing](homing.md), and a capacitor for back-emf mitigation all make the case for a custom PCB. By integrating all of the required electronics onto a single PCB, we avoid the jumper wire spaghetti that plagues many DIY electronics projects as well as enabling sensorless homing without bulky external modules. In the next PCB revision, [V3.0](../boards/v3.0), USB-PD will be supported on-board, further integrating the OSSM control board and reducing the complexity for users.
