# 24V DC Power Supply
The OSSM would not exist without the proliferation of consumer 3D printers. Beyond manufacturing the OSSM's custom parts, consumer 3D printers reduced the cost of high wattage 24V power supplies. From the beginning, the OSSM has taken advantage of this and many OSSMs have been built using Meanwell power supplies that only exist due to the economies of scale presented by 3D printers. 
# USB Power Delivery
We can all agree that USB-C, USB3.0 and USB-PD are a confusing conglomeration of standards but the benefits have created an exciting new way to power the OSSM. Using a USB-PD initiation device, we can request that a USB-PD capable charger supply 20V at 5A through a properly rated USB-C cable. This can be a wall charger or even a USB power bank. The [V3.0](../boards/v3.0.md) OSSM reference board will include USB-PD onboard, for now an adapter cable or trigger board is needed to enable this feature.
