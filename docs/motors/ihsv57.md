## IHSV57-30-x-36
The IHSV57 is a 36V integrated AC servo made by JMC and comes in 3 sizes, related to the maximum rated power: 100W, 140W and 180W. As the price difference between the three sized was minimal and the 180W version left more room between the mounting face and the control box; the IHSV57-30-18-36 was the standard recommended motor until recently. While the motor is rated for 36v there have been multiple reports of the encoder inside the motor failing at voltages greater than 30v. A 24v power supply or 20v USB-C PD supply is more than sufficient.
