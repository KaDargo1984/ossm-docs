# Welcome to the Unofficial OSSM Documentation

## Purpose
The OSSM documentation is currently somewhat fragmented and ephemeral. This is an attempt to capture documentation in a centralized location that covers multiple versions of the OSSM. You can contribute to the documentation in the documentation repo, it is generated using mkdocs and all the source is simple markdown files.
